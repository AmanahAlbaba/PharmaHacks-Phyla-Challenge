"Screening of a library of trimers of N alkylglycines resulted in the identification of two molecules referred to as DD161515 N 2 (2 (N methylpyrrolidinyl)ethylglycyl N 2,4 dichlorophenethylglycyl N (2,4 dichlorophenethyl)glycimide and DD191515 N 3 (N,N diethylamino)propylglycyl N 2,4 dichlorophenethylglycyl N (2,4 dichlorophenethyl)glycimide that selectively block VR1 channel activity with micromolar efficacy, rivaling that characteristic of vanilloid related inhibitors. These compounds appear to be noncompetitive VR1 antagonists that recognize a receptor site distinct from that of capsaicin. Intraperitoneal administration of both trialkylglycines into mice significantly attenuated thermal nociception as measured in the hot plate test. It is noteworthy that these compounds elimited PAIN AND NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION evoked by INTRADERMAL INJECTION OF CAPSAICIN INTO the animal hindpaw, as well as the thermal hyperalgesia induced by tissue irritation with nitrogen mustard. In contrast, responses to mechanical stimuli were not modified by either compound. Modulation of sensory nerve fibers excitability appears to underlie the peptoid algesic activity. Collectively, these results indicate that blockade of VR1 activity attenuates chemical and thermal nociception and hyperalgesia, supporting the tenet that this ionotropic receptor contributes to chemical and thermal sensitivity and pain perception in vivo.","[('PAIN AND NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION', 'DISE'), ('INTRADERMAL INJECTION OF CAPSAICIN INTO', 'SYMP')]","[(799, 831, 'DISE'), (842, 881, 'SYMP')]",1
